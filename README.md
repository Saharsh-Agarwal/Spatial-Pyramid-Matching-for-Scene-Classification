# Spatial Pyramid Matching for Scene Classification
 Classical method - Filter creation and KNN (followed by Spacial Pyramiding and TF-IDF)

This is a part of the work I have done during my Masters @CMU. The Problem Statement is from a course -> (16-720B) Computer Vision. Results were achieved under the guidance of Prof. Devaramanan and the Teaching Assistants. 

The zip folder has the important parts of the assignment, including all the theory and the code. Please do not plagiarize if you're taking the course as well!!! Feel free to reach out to me for anything regarding this.
